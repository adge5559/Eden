# Eden 
Application Description

    Eden is a social media platform created for plant lovers who want to share 
    their passion for plant care. This platform allows users to login to their 
    accounts and post photos of the plants they are caring for, along with tips 
    for growth or challenges they are facing. Users can also search for specific
    plants and be presented with posts from other users and their advice. Each 
    post can be tagged with relevant keywords, making it easy for users to 
    search for specific advice.

	In addition to user content, Eden offers a resource page with general advice
    for different plants, including care tips, ideal temperature ranges, and 
    watering recommendations. This feature provides a quick reference guide for
    plant owners who need information on how to properly care for their green 
    companions. The platform's design ensures that users can easily find what 
    they need, whether it is specific plant care information or another userâ€™s 
    unique insights.

	Eden also includes a discover page, which presents random plant posts to 
    inspire users. Whether users are looking for advice, sharing success stories,
    or browsing through the feed for inspiration, Eden makes it easy for users 
    to connect with others who share a love for plants. The platform is designed 
    to be the ultimate go-to space for personalized plant care, community feedback, 
    and continuous learning in the world of gardening.

Technology Stack: 

    Frontend
        * Express Handlebars (express-handlebars): Used as the templating engine for rendering HTML views on the             server side.
		* Handlebars templates (.hbs files): These files define the structure and content of viewing the 		    page.
