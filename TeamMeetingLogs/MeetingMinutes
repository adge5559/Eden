Week 1 Meeting: Decieded what each team member will be in charge of for the beginning of the project. This can be seen in the Project Board.
General:  Ella - login and logout, partials
          Addison - NavBar, Registration
          Gavin - Discovery/home page
          Leonard - Databases
          Alex - Profile Page and uploading posts.

Week 2 Meeting: Went over how to use the Docker, including our .env. Went over the register page together. Planning to working on Login and 
Logout, as well as some Register, to ensure they are connected with our User Database.

Week 3 Meeting: Discussed specifics on the Discover page and how users will be presented with posts, as well as how they can search for them. 
Login, Logout, and Register pages are fully functional and able to use. Discover page is showing a basic set of posts, hoping to be able to 
link them to the actual posts soon. Profile page is very simple, planning to add more detail this coming week. Going to work on how to upload 
posts this week as well. 

Week 4 Meeting: Disover page has search functionality, so you can find different posts. Can see sample posts with photos, descriptions, comments, 
and likes. Users can also add likes and comments. Need to work on a more overall look for the website, so it looks more put together. Especially 
need to work on users profiles as well as how to make posts. This is important because we can't really see how well the post display on the 
discover page works, as well as post pages, without some variation (tests).
